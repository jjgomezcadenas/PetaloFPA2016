\subsubsection*{Objectives of the ASIC subproject}
Subproject ASIC has the following objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Main objective}: ASIC is in charge of the front-end electronics (FEE) data acquisition (DAQ) and slow controls (SC) for the P1, P2 and PEP apparatus. ASIC is also in charge of characterising the sensors for the prototypes and study the performance of electronics in cryogenic conditions. 
\item {\bf Shared objectives with subproject DET}: Study of the performance of P1, P2 and PEP. In particular, the researchers from ASIC will focus in the CRT measurements. 
\item {\bf Shared objectives with subproject DET and with project from UB}: Study of the performance of fast detectors and electronics for detection of Cherenkov light in xenon.
\item {\bf Shared objectives project from UB}: Study of the performance of FlexToT (as an alternative to the baseline PETSYS ASIC). 
\end{enumerate}
