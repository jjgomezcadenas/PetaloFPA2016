\subsubsection*{Objectives of the DET subproject}
Subproject DET has the following objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Main objective}: construction and commissioning of the P1, P2 and PEP apparatus, including the cryogenics and the gas system.
\item {\bf Shared objectives with subproject IMG}: the development of the {\em SIMulation for the PetaLo Experiment} (SIMPLE), and the development of the {\em Reconstruction and Analysis environment for Petalo} (RAP).
\item {\bf Shared objectives with subproject ASIC}: Study of the performance of P1, P2 and PEP. 
\item {\bf Shared objectives with subproject ASIC and with project from UB}: Study of the performance of fast detectors and electronics for detection of Cherenkov light in xenon. 
\end{enumerate}


%Accordingly, the objectives of this subproject are divided in two groups, DET-HARD and DET-SOFT.
