\subsubsection*{Objectives of the DET subproject}
Subproject DET has the following objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Construction and commissioning of the P2 and PEP apparatus}, including the cryogenics and the gas system.
\item {\bf Software and reconstruction}, namely the {\em SIMulation for the PetaLo Experiment} (SIMPLE), and the the {\em Reconstruction and Analysis environment for Petalo} (RAP). 
\item {\bf Shared objectives with subproject IMG}: Development of imaging reconstruction algorithms for PEP. Development of imaging algorithms for a large PETALO scanner (using Monte Carlo simulation data).
\item {\bf Shared objectives with subproject ASIC}: Study of the performance of P2 and PEP. 
\item {\bf Shared objectives with subproject ASIC and with project from UB group}: Study of the performance of fast detectors and electronics for detection of Cherenkov light in xenon. 
\end{enumerate}
