\subsubsection*{Objectives of the ASIC subproject}
Subproject IMG has the following objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Main objective}: Development of the imaging software for PEP and for a large PETALO scanner. Extraction of biomarkers from the images obtained operating PEP. Integration of PEP in a clinical environment (experimental radiology unit at the hospital La Fe). 
\item {\bf Shared objectives with subproject DET}: the development of SIMPLE, and the development of RAP. The DET group will be in charge of the basic reconstruction (singles and doubles, LORs) and IMG group will contribute with specific software for imaging such as attenuation correction, artefacts correction, backpropagation algorithms and TOF-backgpropagation.
\end{enumerate}
