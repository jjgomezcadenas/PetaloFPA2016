\subsubsection*{Objectives of the ASIC subproject}
Subproject IMG has the following objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Main objective}: Extraction of biomarkers from the images obtained operating PEP. This will also require the integration of PEP in a clinical environment (experimental radiology unit at the hospital La Fe). 
\item {\bf Shared objectives with subproject DET}: the development of SIMPLE, and the development of RAP. The DET group will be in charge of the basic reconstruction (singles and doubles, LORs) and IMG group will contribute with specific software for imaging such as attenuation correction, artefacts correction, backpropagation algorithms and TOF-backgpropagation.
\end{enumerate}
