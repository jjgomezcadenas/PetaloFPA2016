\subsubsection*{Subproject DET}

IFIC is one of the larges research institutes in nuclear, particle and astroparticle physics in Spain. It has been distinguished in 2015 with the Severo Ochoa award. IFIC will provide support for the PETALO project, providing laboratory space, access to general facilities, and the support of the technical divisions. Computing resources are also available at IFIC, as well as a good mechanical workshop and TPB coating facilities. In addition, the DET group will benefit from the know-how and expertise of the NEXT group, in particular in the development of the xenon gas system.  

\subsubsection*{Co-funding proposal}
The DET group requires funding for the construction of the cryogenic and gas systems, as well as the mechanics of the P2 and PEP detectors. The costs are detailed in Table \ref{tab.costs.det}
